Hi! I am currently a sophomore double majoring in AI (Course 6-4) and Math (Course 18) at MIT. I am currently advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/) at MIT. I am interested in **robot learning and planning**, and I am currently working on methods to make robot learn efficiently in low-data regime!
